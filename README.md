Hi there, I decided to make this when my bike got stolen, i hope that you find it useful! 

This is a basic scraping script that hopefully will show any bikes on sale, i tried to make it as simple to
follow, but im also not the best programmer XD.  

Gumtree only allows for keywords, so make sure the keywords are more detailed for better matches on there
Gumtree also seems to find less matches in general, I dont know whether this is there are less bikes on there
or the algorithm isn't as good, but you may want to have a lower ratio for that one than ebay  

Dont expect many matches with Edinburgh location naturally, but means matches you do get will be more promising  

Good luck, I hope your search is prosperous!
